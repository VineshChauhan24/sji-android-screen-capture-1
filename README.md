[How to use]  
  
1.<b>Setup PC Environment (Windows/Mac/Linux/Unix)</b>  
<pre><code><a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">Install Android SDK</a> (at least "Platform Tools" which include adb(Android Debug Bridge)).  
<a href="http://nodejs.org/download/">install node.js</a>.  
Install android USB driver automatically or manually when you first plug Android into PC.
If you want to always record as H.264/MP4 or WebM video format, you need <a href="http://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html">install FFMPEG into PC</a>.
</code></pre>
To simplify other settings, you'd better put the directory of adb and local ffmpeg into PATH environment variable otherwise you need put the fullpath of them into "adb" and "ffmpeg" settings in stream.json file.
<br/><br/>
2.<b>Start Android Screen Capture (include a video stream server) on PC</b>
<pre><code>
node dir_of_this_project/bin/stream.js
</code></pre>
You can edit configuration file <a href="https://raw.github.com/sjitech/sji-android-screen-capture/master/bin/stream.json">stream.json</a> to change IP, port, SSL...
<br/><br/>
Or you can specify your own configuration file which can be copied from config.json file in this dir.
<pre><code>
node dir_of_this_project/bin/stream.js dir_of_your_config/myConfig.json
</code></pre>
3.<b>Show video/animated image of android from PC by browsing <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000/</a></b>  <br/>
